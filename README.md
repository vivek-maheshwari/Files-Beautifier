# File Beautifier

This script automates the beautification of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP) within a specified directory. It utilizes various beautification libraries to enhance readability and consistency of code.

## Features

- Automatically beautifies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files in a directory.
- Counts and displays the number of files beautified for each file type.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required libraries (`jsbeautifier`, `autopep8`, `beautifulsoup4`, `cssbeautifier`) installed. You can install these using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install jsbeautifier autopep8 beautifulsoup4 cssbeautifier
  ```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the script (`beautify_files.py`) to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing `beautify_files.py`.

### Execution

Replace `your_directory_path` in the script with the actual path to the directory containing files you want to beautify.

```bash
python beautify_files.py
```

### Output

After execution, the script will display the number of files beautified for each file type (`html`, `css`, `js`, `php`).

## Notes

- Ensure you have appropriate permissions to modify files within the specified directory.
- Back up your files before running the script, especially if working with critical codebases.
